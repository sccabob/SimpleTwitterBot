Make sure that tweepy is installed on your system.

1) Install postCuracaoPictures.py in any folder you like.

2) Create a folder named images in the folder that contains the file postCuracaoPictures.py

3) Place the images that you want posted to your Twitter account in the images folder.

4) Edit postCuracaoPictures.py by placing the proper keys in the appropriate variable (see comments in the file)

5) Run postCuracaoPictures.py from the command line.

To Do:

Create a command line app that would take input from the user to set the keys and tokens, then point to the folder that contains the desired images.
